                <p>Have you ever watched The Wolf of Wall Street and wondered how Jordan Belfort made so much money selling
                    stocks that cost a fraction of a dollar?</p>
                <p>Well, there were the lies to investors and the fraudulent pump and dump tactics which account for the rise
                    of his empire, but before he started Stratton Oakmont he was still making big money without breaking the law.
                    How?</p>

                <p>The rest of Wall Street had written off penny stocks because they didn't represent the REAL players in the
                economy and left them to small one-off brokers like 'Investors' Center' who might sell just as many stocks
                by volume, but touch a fraction of the money.</p>
                <p>What Jordan Belfort realized, was that <b>100,000 pennies is worth just as much as
                a single 100 dollar bill</b>. He could charge the same percentage for a sale as any of the big Wall Street
                brokers, so all he had to do to make the same paycheck was to sell more shares, and when a stock costs a penny,
                selling 100,000 of them was merely a matter of convincing that investor to break their $100 up.</p>

                <p>But why would they do that? After all, buying one share of an established company is much safer than buying
                    100,000 shares of a puny company that could go under on any given day.</p>
                <p>The greater the risk, the greater the reward, and in this case that concept is taken to new heights. If one
                    day that stock starts trading for 2 cents, all of a sudden that $100 is now $200 in a matter of hours!
                    That $100 stock could never. It might be work $120 after a good year an the investors would be thrilled.
                    Granted, that 1 cent stock could just as easily go to 0 cents, but people are optimistic, and greedy.</p>

        <h3>So what does all of this have to do with The PennyStockBot?</h3>
        <h4>We're taking that understanding of <span style="color:#90EE90">volume</span> and
        <span style="color:rgba(220,53,69,0.5)">volatility</span> and programming them into an automated trading
        algorithm to take advantage of those rewards while minimizing the risks.</h4>
        <p>Unlike Jordan Belfort who was profiting off of the sales, we're trying to capitalize on those massive
        fluctuations in the stock values. That means that we're incurring the risk as well, but instead of falling
        victim to the pitch of an effective broker, we're using data, emotionless computer logic, and safeguards.</p>

        <p>Yfinance, the Python package used by this algorithm provides open/close and high/low prices for each specified
          interval over the course of the period, it does not indicate actual transaction instances with price, volume, and
          bid/ask information. As a result, I attempted to create a conservative estimate of transaction volumes and was
          unable to account for larger bids/asks that would take precedent over certain attempted transactions.</p>
